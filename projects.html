      <h2> ⭐️Humans of Chicago ⭐️ </h2>
      <p>✨  Inspired by Humans of New York (HONY),
        this project is aiming at recording and sharing stories of people who are in Chicago.
        <br>✨ There are so many stories around world, good or bad ones,
        the life we are living is limited – we are limited in certain circle –
        we stay in a city, in a country, we do some work but never pay attention to other’s life –
        those who live around us, who experiencing a total different life from us –
        they teach us how to cherish life, how to make peace with this world. </br><i>Humans of Chicago</i> is my project toward earning the M.S. degree.</p>
